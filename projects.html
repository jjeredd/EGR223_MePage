            <div class="p1">A flutter based web application that allows users to verify diplomas using blockchain. Partner universities would upload their students diplomas via our web portal which stores the document onto our blockchain. Employers and other 3rd parties can then upload a diploma sent in by an applicant and our app would then check to see if the document is on the blockchain. If it is, the document is verified, if it isn't, the document is either fake or tampered with.</div>

            <div class ="h1">ROB the Robot</div>
            <div class ="p1">Using a Lego Mindstorm Kit, Acrylic, and a remote controlled gear box, my team was able to build a robot that can drive around and collect/shoot orbs for our Intro to Engineering class. I mostly worked on constructing the drive base and the code to get the robot's launcher working.</div>
